## Dataset

Our dataset contains data on 7.4 million trips between airports in the United States in the year 2007. It contains variables such as flight duration, distance and delays

## Summary of Findings

In our analysis, we noticed that variables were strongly correlated, such as departure delay and arrival delay or distance and elapsed time. which was completely conceivable. So it came to us to ask questions
- Which airlines are the most subject to delays?
- What are the airports with the longest delays?
- What can be the causes of these delays?
- What are the main causes of flight cancellations? in every airport and airline?

We had as an answer that the delays have a small causality with the airport, the airline and the route.

Flight cancellations are mainly due to weather conditions, followed by the carrier and the national airline system.
Some routes have a large number of cancellations.

When we study hijacked flights, virtually no company or airport is spared. the departure time is often the same in these cases. during the day, rarely when it is dark.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the preparation I first went to the presentation of the fleet in 2007 then I focused my gaze on the data provided about airlines
